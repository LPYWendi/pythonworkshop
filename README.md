**Python Beginner Workshop**

Welcome! Are you completely new to programming? If not then we presume you will be looking for information about why and how to get started with Python. Fortunately an experienced programmer in any programming language (whatever it may be) can pick up Python very quickly. It's also easy for beginners to use and learn, so jump in!

Python come in version 2 and 3, and they are somewhat compatible but not the same. For this particular workshop, we are going to stay with Python 2.7. For your SSIP, please discuss with your company supervisor what is the company choice and follow accordingly. The differences between the two version can be found at the following [link](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html).
