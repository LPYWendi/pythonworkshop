# Lesson 3 Flow Control

Python had flow control such as for, while, if else and etc just like those you learn in c programming. Python had more flow control and are usually more flexible.

There are tons of great resources online that teaches python, it is not my intention to create just another of these tutorial. 
The intention is to cultivate the ability to use online resource to adapt to new language.
We would be following, the following tutorial closely for our workshop:
